# Realtor's Housing Price Prediction App - Canada

This repository hosts the development of a real estate price prediction app for realtors in Canada. The app scrapes weekly housing data from **Kijiji** and uses machine learning to predict prices for the upcoming week. It notifies realtors when listings are undervalued and, in the future, will provide recommendations on how to increase property value through potential improvements.

## Features

- **Price Predictions**: Uses machine learning to predict housing prices for the coming week.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Notifies realtors about listings priced lower than predicted.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Recommendations for modifications to enhance property value.
  - Insights into market trends and property features that affect pricing.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- Listing price
- Location (city, postal code)
- Property size (sq ft)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Property age and additional features (garage, garden, etc.)

Weekly updates ensure that the model stays current with the latest market trends.


## Roadmap
